We are using the Spiral Model in our project. 
Something as complex as a Unity Game is going to be a large undertaking.
We believe that, by using the Spiral, that we will be able to work much more quickly within each prototype.
We already have an extremely rudimentary prototype.
We are working to improve it with new features and fixes to old ones.

Our current outline for the goals of each prototype is:
1. Player Movement (current step)
2. Terrain and Collision
3. Room Traversal and Objective
4. Enemy Creation
5. Combat
6. Polishing

It is going to be a lot of work, planning and communication to achieve each prototype.
These are all things the Spiral Model will help us to excel at.
I hope that everything will go well, and we can work on small increments to make something enjoyable to play.
